# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At ITG Software, we take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us directly using GitHub's Security Advisories feature. This allows you to report security vulnerabilities privately and securely.

To report a vulnerability, follow these steps:
1. Go to the "Security" tab of our repository.
2. Click on "Report a security vulnerability".
3. Fill out the required information in the form.
4. Click "Submit report".

Once we receive your report, we will promptly review it and take appropriate action. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any potential security issues and helping us keep our project safe and secure for everyone.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow the principles of responsible disclosure, which means we will:
- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible.
- Work with you to understand and validate the issue.
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
- Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, if you wish.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project safe and secure for everyone. Thank you for your cooperation and support in making our project better.
