# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At ITG Software, we take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any potential issues.

To report a vulnerability, please email us directly at [salesforce@itgsoftware.com](mailto:salesforce@itgsoftware.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. We also welcome any additional information you can provide to help us understand and address the issue.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to review and address it. We strive to promptly respond to all reports and will work with you to understand and resolve any security concerns.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow the principles of responsible disclosure, which means we will:
- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible.
- Work with you to understand and validate the issue.
- Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
- Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure, if you wish.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project safe and secure for everyone. Thank you for your cooperation and support in making our project better.
